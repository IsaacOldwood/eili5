				<h3>How do water wells work?</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="answer">
					Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places.
					<br>
					Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time.
					<br>
					Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.

				<h3>Why do we instinctually make noises when we get hurt?</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="answer">
					Humans are social animals. Communication is hard wired into us. If we are hurt, the most helpful thing to do is to let those around us know immediately. It alerts the group to possible dangers and threats, and let’s everyone know you may need immediate aid.

				<h3>Why are iron, cobalt, and nickel magnetic, but other metals are not?</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="answer">
					This is a really complex topic, but to start, electrons act basically as tiny little magnets. They have a North Pole and a South Pole, and put out a tiny magnetic field.
					<br>
					In a lot of elements, electrons pair up, pointing in opposite directions, and mostly cancel out the magnetism, but some elements have unpaired electrons, which lets the magnetism add up, instead of cancelling.
					<br>
					Even this isn’t enough though. Some atoms like to line up facing opposite directions, cancelling the magnetism. Only certain elements like lining up all in the same direction, creating an even stronger magnetic field.
					<br>
					These atoms are called “ferromagnetic”, and that’s the type of magnetism you’re talking about. Because all their atoms like lining up in the same direction, and they have unpaired electrons, they can create a magnetic field, and respond strongly to outside magnetic fields.

				<h3>Why do fingerprints stay the same despite pressure and stress throughout our lives?</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="answer">
					The outermost layer of your skin is primarily dead cells. It's a very thin but very effective plating of armor that is constantly getting worn away by the environment, but it's getting replaced from underneath just as fast as it wears away, if not faster.
					<br>
					Those dead cells keep growing into the same patterns (AKA your fingerprints) because they're growing in the same pattern as the deeper layers of your skin. That underlying skin stays relatively unchanged since the outer layers protect it. If you manage to damage these layers from severe burns, corrosive chemical exposure, or deep flesh wounding, you can permanently alter or even destroy your fingerprints. But common activities practically never make it past the outer layer, so in most situations fingerprints will always grow in the same pattern across your entire life.

				<h3>How do spam callers mask their phone numbers to ones registered to someone else?</h3>
				<hr>
				<p class="answer">
					When you get a phone call and a number shows up on your caller ID, that's not always because your phone knows which number is calling it. The phone that's calling you can send the call and tell your phone what number to show, plus maybe a name as well. Scammers use a VoIP phone and can just alter the data that their phone sends to your phone, your phone doesn't know any better and just shows what ever the other phone tells it to show.
